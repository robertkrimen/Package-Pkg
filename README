NAME
    Package::Pkg - Handy package munging utilities

VERSION
    version 0.0011

SYNOPSIS
    First, import a new keyword: "pkg"

        use Package::Pkg;

    Subroutine installation:

        pkg->install( sub { ... } => 'MyPackage::myfunction' );

        # myfunction in MyPackage is now useable
        MyPackage->myfunction( ... );

    Subroutine exporting:

        package MyPackage;

        use Package::Pkg;

        sub this { ... }

        # Setup an exporter for MyPackage, exporting 'this' and 'that'
        pkg->export( that => sub { ... }, 'this' );

        package main;

        use MyPackage;

        this( ... );

        that( ... );

DESCRIPTION
    Package::Pkg is a collection of useful, miscellaneous package-munging
    utilities. Functionality is accessed via the imported "pkg" keyword,
    although you can also invoke functions directly from the package
    ("Package::Pkg")

USAGE
  install
    Install a subroutine, similar to Sub::Install (and actually using that
    module to do the dirty work)

  export( ... )
    Setup an importer in the calling package

SEE ALSO
    Sub::Install

    Sub::Exporter
