NAME
    Package::Pkg - Handy package munging utilities

VERSION
    version 0.0015

SYNOPSIS
    First, import a new keyword: "pkg"

        use Package::Pkg;

    Package name formation:

        pkg->name( 'Xy', 'A' ) # Xy::A
        pkg->name( $object, qw/ Cfg / ); # (ref $object)::Cfg

    Subroutine installation:

        pkg->install( sub { ... } => 'MyPackage::myfunction' );

        # myfunction in MyPackage is now useable
        MyPackage->myfunction( ... );

    Subroutine exporting:

        package MyPackage;

        use Package::Pkg;

        sub this { ... }

        # Setup an exporter (literally sub import { ... }) for
        # MyPackage, exporting 'this' and 'that'
        pkg->export( that => sub { ... }, 'this' );

        package main;

        use MyPackage;

        this( ... );

        that( ... );

DESCRIPTION
    Package::Pkg is a collection of useful, miscellaneous package-munging
    utilities. Functionality is accessed via the imported "pkg" keyword,
    although you can also invoke functions directly from the package
    ("Package::Pkg")

USAGE
  pkg->install( ... )
    Install a subroutine, similar to Sub::Install (and actually using that
    module to do the dirty work)

  $package = pkg->name( <part>, [ <part>, ..., <part> ] )
    Return a namespace composed by joining each <part> with "::"

    Superfluous/redundant "::" are automatically cleaned up and stripped
    from the resulting $package

    If the first part leads with a "::", the the calling package will be
    prepended to $package

        pkg->name( 'Xy', 'A::', '::B' )      # Xy::A::B
        pkg->name( 'Xy', 'A::' )             # Xy::A::
    
        {
            package Zy;

            pkg->name( '::', 'A::', '::B' )  # Zy::A::B
            pkg->name( '::Xy::A::B' )        # Zy::Xy::A::B
        }

    In addition, if any part is blessed, "name" will resolve that part to
    the package that the part makes reference to:

        my $object = bless {}, 'Xyzzy';
        pkg->name( $object, qw/ Cfg / );     # Xyzzy::Cfg
